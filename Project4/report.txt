1. Obstacles

Some of the notable obstacles were figuring out how to do the split function without using a second array, trying to find enough test cases for each function, and trying to figure out what bad input to check for in each function.

2. Test Data

appendToAll:
    
string h[7] = {"selina", "reed", "diana", "tony", "logan", "", "peter"};
    
  * appendToAll(h, )
